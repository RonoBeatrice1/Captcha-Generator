# Captcha Generator

This is a simple web-based Captcha generator and validator. It generates a random Captcha code, displays it on the page, and allows users to enter the code for validation.

## How It Works

- When you open the web page, a random Captcha code is generated and displayed in a designated container.

- You can enter the Captcha code in the input field provided and click the "Submit" button.

- If the entered code matches the generated Captcha, you'll receive an "Valid Captcha" alert. Otherwise, you'll see an "Invalid Captcha. Try Again" alert.

- After validation, a new random Captcha code is generated for the next validation.
